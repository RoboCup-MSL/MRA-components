== Coordinate Systems

There are two coordinate systems:

* <<Field Coordinate System (FCS)>>
* <<Object Coordinate System (OCS)>>


=== Field Coordinate System (FCS)

Most data regarding robots, obstacles or ball are to be defined in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system defined according to the following rules (see figure <<FCS_figure>>):

* the Field coordinate system is defined as viewed from the own side of the field;
* the Field coordinate system follows the right system principle;
* the 'XY' plane is coincident with the field floor;
* the origin of the coordinate system is coincident with the center of the field;
* the x-axis is coincident with the center of the mid-field line and positive to the right;
* the y-axis is positive towards the opponent goal;
* the z-axis is positive above the ground;
* angles are measured from the X-axis, or from any other line parallel to the 'X' axis, in the counter.
clockwise direction, and are defined in the interval [0..2π];
* angle arithmetic uses (mod 2π).


=== Object Coordinate System (OCS)

The Object Coordinate System follows the right system principle;

* the Object Coordinate System is defined as viewed from the middle of the object towards the front of the object (for a robot this is the side used to manipulate the ball)
* the 'XY' plane is coincident with the ground;
* the origin of the coordinate system is coincident with the center of the object;
* the x-axis is coincident with the center of the object and positive to the right;
* the y-axis is positive towards the front of the object;
* the z-axis is positive above the ground;

In the figure <<OCS_figure>> the x- and y-axis of an object (robot) are shown when the object has an angle q wrt the Field Coordinate System (capital X an Y axis)
