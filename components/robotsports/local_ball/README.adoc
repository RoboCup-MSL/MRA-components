= LocalBall Robotsports Variant

== Summary

LocalBall is a component that tracks the ball position based on measurements from local sensors
(omnivision and frontcamera). It combines the local ball preprocessor and the local ball tracking.
Poses are using the Field Coordinate System, therefore is not necessary to correct for own movements 
between the ticks when tracking an object multiple ticks . 

== Scope and context

This variant is RobotSport variant of local ball. 
 
== Interface details

* **purpose**: track the ball with local sensors
* **inputs**: See link:./interface/Input.proto[Input.proto] for the exact definition.
    ** Omnivision BallCandidates  
    ** Stereo vision BallCandidates  

* **outputs**:  See link:./interface/Output.proto[Output.proto] for the exact definition.  
    ** ball position

* *parameters*:  
The component has some configuration parameters.  These parameters are specific for this variant., 
see link:./interface/Params.proto[Params.proto] and 
link:./interface/DefaultParams.json[DefaultParams.json].

== Design

Calculate location of the ball based on the measurements

Component consist of two steps:

* link:../local_ball_preprocessor/README.adoc[Robotsport Local Ball preprocessor]
* link:../local_ball_tracking/README.adoc[Robotsport Local Ball tracking]

Note: The component has own internal state data administration and does not store it a protobuf state structure.
It is not following the MSL Reference Architecture as intended; it makes it harder to observe the state externally.
 

== Testing
The component has several tests to validate the working of the component.
A basic ball trajectory generator provides input data for tests.
Currently simple linear ball paths are tested.

The trajectory generator can be extended to (future work):

* add noise on measurement (simulating measurement noise)
* add noise on own position (simulating self-localisation noise)
* add multiple ball candidates (simulating fake balls or ball further away)
* add ball velocity increasing (pass, kick) or decreasing (ball bounced or caught) 

== Visualizing ball tracking
The output of the algorithm can be visualized with some simple plots.  
(future work)
