# Reflexxes (type II) Motion Library

This library contains an *unmodified* copy from the original at https://github.com/Reflexxes/RMLTypeII
with the intent to make its functionality available for inner use in MRA components.

Wrapper CMake and Bazel files are provided.

(TODO: consider using CMake `FetchContent` and Bazel BCR instead of full source copy.)
