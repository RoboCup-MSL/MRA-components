===  get_bal [[get_bal]]
Robot move to have the ball will be in the beak of the robot.

* *purpose*: get the ball
* *inputs*:
** WorldState
** max_speed_factor [from Reasoning]
*** set to low (say 50%), to smoothly and accurately perform a set-piece.
*** set to high (say 120%) when the situation calls for it
**** for example: ball is about to roll out of field, a sprint is needed, or: one minute left to play, one goal behind, take risk

* *outputs*:
** robot target set-point (type posvel in FCS) [to PathPlanning]
** actionResult [to Reasoning]
** estimated time to get the ball (s), for query/decisioning purpose [to Reasoning]

* *subcomponents* (select exactly one):
** getball-fetch: get a stationary ball
** getball-follow: get a ball moving away from robot
** getball-intercept: get a ball which is moving towards robot
** getball-steal: get a ball which is engaged by opponent
** getball-bounce: get a ball which is bouncing

* *parameters*:
* ball speed “stationary” and “bounce” thresholds to determine if ball is stationary or bouncing
* combined parameters from subcomponents
