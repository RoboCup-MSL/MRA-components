= MSL Reference Architecture

The MSL Reference Architecture is intended to increase the reuse of developments between the MSL teams.

== Re-usability
Re-usability can help to increase the development speed of MSL league.

**Advantages:**

* Re-use of proven concepts of other teams; focus on own strength instead of do everything a bit.
* Get more balanced games between existing MSL teams.
* New MSL teams can faster participate and start at a competitive level.

**Rationale:**

* Limited re-use in MSL in the last 20 years. +
Re-use (software) clearly worked in other leagues: simulation league, standard platform league
* New MSL teams need too much time to be able to play and are not competitive.


== MSL league
In RoboCup MSL teams of five fully autonomous robots play soccer with a regular size FIFA soccer ball. Teams are free to design their own hardware but all sensors have to be on-board and there is a maximum size and weight for the robots. The research focus is on mechatronics design, control and multi-agent cooperation at plan and perception levels. (source: link:https://www.robocup.org[www.robocup.org])

The MSL league has its own website: https://msl.robocup.org

== Standardisation within MSL
There is no mandatory standard to be followed within the MSL.
Standardisation has big advances for the league; it can help to accelerated innovation.

=== Hardware Standardisation
Within the MSL robots  often have a similar design. There is no standard defined, but
most teams are using a proven common used design. The Robotic Open Platform was created to share the robot hardware design (http://roboticopenplatform.org)

Many MSL teams using most similar, but not equal hardware for:

- driving: omni-wheels
- sensing: omni-vision, stereo vision
- kicking: MSL kicker
- Ball-handling

A lot of concepts look quite similar, however most teams decided to make their own variant of a concept instead of re-use a hardware module as already designed. Re-use of existing modules could have saved time and money.

The commonality in hardware is taken into account, but own versions or different concepts should be supported by the software standard.

Analyse on commonality in hardware can be found in an article about: link:https://www.techunited.nl/media/images/ROP_RoboCup_Symposium_2013_Open_Hardware_Track.pdf[ROP]



=== Software Standardisation
In the period till 2023 source code of the software was often published by the MSL teams. This did not result in reuse of software.

Most software was not designed for sharing:

* Limited documentation
* Strong coupling with the specific hardware

Within MSL there are a few exceptions where software reuse was applied:

* Simulator
** link:https://github.com/RoboCup-MSL/MSL-Simulator/wiki[MSL Simulator]. +
Based on the simulator from Nubot:

** link:https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/188083876/0958546_Nijland.pdf[Common Simulator] by Tech United: connecting different simulators

Via the MSL rules all the teams must:

* follow the instructions from the link:https://github.com/RoboCup-MSL/RefBox[MSL Refbox].
* Log data during the game via MSL logging protocol link:https://msl.robocup.org/requirements[ (WM Data Struct)].

The link:https://github.com/RoboCup-MSL/MixedTeamProtocol[MSL Mixed-Team protocol] is created to be able to play with different teams as a single team. This protocol is created by Falcons and Robotsports. It was demonstrated as a technical challenge at RoboCup 2021 (link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfD_qd239Z4&t=4330s[movie] / link:https://robotsports.nl/images/2021/RoboCup2021_MSL_Technical_challenge_Falcons_and_VDL_robotsports_MixedTeam_Protocol.pdf[presentation]).

Most initiatives are published in the link:https://github.com/RoboCup-MSL[RoboCup-MSL repository] on GitHub

== Scope MSL Reference Architecture
The scope of MSL Reference Architecture is limited to software.

The scope of the MSL Reference architecture is depicted in the <<MSL_Reference_Architecture_System_Context_Diagram>>.

== What is interesting to share
If a module is well-designed, tested and documented it is better sharable.
For MSL teams the following candidates for sharing and reuse have been identified:

* Object Tracking
* Self localization
* Team strategy (comply to all MSL rules)
* Skills
* AI developments
* Hardware modules:
	** vision
	** drive
	** ball-handling
	** kicker
* Calibration tools
* Simulator

== MSL Reference Architecture platform
The "MRA platform" is an online platform that acts as a central place where components can be uploaded and downloaded.
It is proposed to have one repository called "MRA" in the MSL project.

Decision to be made collectively, at WorldCup Bordeaux, or MSL workshop.
Roadmap/alternative: split MRA-components repo from MRA-platform. +
(Maintain component content similar to BazelCentralRegistry.)  +
(Maybe even MRA-engine, etc.) +

There is a distinction between MRA users and MRA developers.

* *MRA users*: the MRA user simply import one or more components from the MRA platform and use it for their robots as an imported piece of software.
* *MRA developers*: they are creating and / or improving MRA components or MRA infrastructure software which will become available for all MRA users.  By sharing the developments the MSL teams can improve their team via the MRA Platform.

&nbsp;

REQ-PLAT-01::
It shall be possible (and "easy") for users to integrate MRA components in their team software repository. +
*Rationale*: usability is key to success of this initiative.

REQ-PLAT-02::
MRA developers must have a way to make components depend on standard libraries +
*Rationale*: reuse existing code / functionality. +
*Example*: dependency on opencv +

REQ-PLAT-03::
MRA developers must have a way to make components depend on other components. +
*Rationale*: reuse, modularity, testability +
*Examples*: getball depends on multiple specific getball-* components.

[#REQ-PLAT-04]
REQ-PLAT-04::
MRA developers must have a way to make components depend on MSL-shared libraries. +
*Rationale*: reuse existing code / functionality, prevent re-implementation +
*Examples* : basic common data types (refbox commands, WorldState), common geometrical operations

REQ-PLAT-05::
 A MRA components shall be independent or only depending on MRA components and/or generic general purposes components (portability). +
*Rationale*: If a MRA components will not be portable if it depends on a team-specific implementations. +
*Note*: developers should instead consider to contribute to MSL-shared libraries. +
*Roadmap*: consider static library linking, FMI/FMU packaging.


DEC-PLAT-01::
It is decided to support teams embedding MRA as git subrepository.

DEC-PLAT-02::
It is decided to provide support for the following build tools:
* link:https://cmake.org/[cmake]
* link:https://bazel.build/[bazel]

DEC-PLAT-03::
It is decided to maintain MSL-shared libraries for now in the prototype MRA repository.
*Roadmap*: split it up (as mentioned earlier).
