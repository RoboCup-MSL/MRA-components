== Hardware
The package defines the generic interfaces for hardware within the MSL robot.
The generic interfaces allow the users of the package to define algorithms independent of the hardware

The following hardware interfaces are defined:

* drive
* kicker
* imu
* lidar
* xref:./vision.adoc[vision]
** omni-vision
** stereo-vision
* timestamp (clock)

=== hardware module interface

A hardware driver should use the interface for an implementation.
A hardware driver can have more methods than only the interface, but this extended interface should only be used for testing and debugging. If used for other purposes a generic usage of the driver by its clients is not possible .
