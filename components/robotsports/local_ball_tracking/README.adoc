= LocalBallTracking Robotsports Variant

== Summary

LocalBallTracking is an component that tracks the ball position based on measurements. 
Poses are using the Field Coordinate System, therefore is not necessary to correct for own movements 
between the ticks when tracking an object multiple ticks . 

== Scope and context

This variant is RobotSport variant of local ball tracking. 
The original code is written by: Rene van de Molengraft (TechUnited), March, 2008


== Interface details

* **purpose**: track the ball with local sensors
* **inputs**: See link:./interface/Input.proto[Input.proto] for the exact definition.
    ** BallCandidates  

* **outputs**:  See link:./interface/Output.proto[Output.proto] for the exact definition.  
    ** ball position

* *parameters*:  
The component has some configuration parameters.  These parameters are specific for this variant., 
see link:./interface/Params.proto[Params.proto] and 
link:./interface/DefaultParams.json[DefaultParams.json].

== Design

Calculate location of the ball based on the measurements (Sequential Clustering algorithm)

Inspired by Schubert & Sidenblath, Sequential clustering with particle filters - Estimating the number of clusters from data, Proc. 8th Int. Conf. Information Fusion, 2005

Instead of using a particle filter, a discrete filter to the set of hypotheses is applies, which is of itself already a discrete stochast.

As the ball is likely to move,  a constant-velocity model-based Kalman filter is used to estimate the state of the ball.

The algorithm assumes that the ball is rolling freely. In future additional check can be added to verify if ball is truely rolling freely.
Ball is marked as airborne if the z is above 20cm (ball on the floor has z of 0). 


Note: The component has own internal state data administration and does not store it a protobuf state structure.
It is not following the MSL Reference Architecture as intended. 




== History

Used by Robotsports since 2013, started as a copy of TechUnited's ball tracking algorithm

* March, 19th, 2008, added bound checking and error handling
* February, 13th, 2009, adapted for sorted measurements with varying time interval in between (kalman_update) added object labeling on creation of new object
* May, 8th, 2011, adapted for ball model
* May, 13th, 2011, assume a single ball; removed all book keeping for multiple objects
* June, 26th, 2011, exchanged recursive Kalman filter for batch-wise least-squares estimator (integral formulation)
* May, 20th, 2012, smooth free/non-free transition and kick-aware speed estimation
