Documentation:
==============
* **TODO** add documentation in subdirectory (start with updated copy from robotsports)

REMAINING WORK (TODO list) - to create first version:
==================================================== 

* Use Protobuf on the interface
* Clean up interfaces
** remove unused data
** document inputs and outputs properly
** restructure: split role assignement and calculate rough path
* Bazel support
* remove TODOs
* updated based on known issues in original code
** filter objects to defined: only inside the playing field (including goal) or (max X from ball)
** apply additional cost of edges outside the playing field (scaled with distance to outerlines of the playing field)
** fix overshoot in graphs
* Create generic types / library functions (candidates):
** FieldConfig
** MathUtils
* Review

* Output as MRA roles instead of robotsports specific roles (these are mixing behavior and role)
