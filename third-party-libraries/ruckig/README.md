# Ruckig - Instantaneous Motion Generation for Robots and Machines

This library contains an *unmodified*, but reduced copy from the original at https://github.com/pantor/ruckig
with the intent to make its functionality available for inner use in MRA components.

Wrapper CMake and Bazel files are provided.

(TODO: consider using CMake `FetchContent` and Bazel BCR instead of source copy.)

More about Ruckig can be found at https://ruckig.com
or read the [Ruckig README](./ruckig/README.md)
